## Overview

This is a simple replacement style mod designed to add the armor from HBO's Game of Thrones to CK3. Courtiers assigned to the kingsguard will be equipped with armor from the Game Of Thrones TV series. The armor can also be equipped via the in game barbershop.

Additionally, the ruler of the realm can change the armor style using a unique decision.
